Make a conscious effort to attend classes regularly, take notes, and participate actively in discussions. This will help you stay updated with the coursework and build connections with professors and peers.",

Break down larger projects into smaller, achievable chunks, and allocate dedicated time for studying each day. Review your schedule regularly to ensure it remains effective.",
